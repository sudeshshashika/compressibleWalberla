GDB Pretty Printer Usage
------------------------


GDB Pretty Printers are python scripts that changes the display of data structures in the debugger.
For example a std::vector is not shown with its internal representation, but more like a native C/C++ array.
Pretty Printers exists for most of STL's and Boost's data types.

For a few waLBerla data structures (Field, GhostLayerField) pretty printers are also available.

The pretty printers can be activated for all debug sessions, or only for certain executables.

0) Set your python path
	make sure the folder utilities is in your python path
	the utilites/bashhelper/source_me.sh file takes automatically care of that

1) Global Activation
	- create file "~/.gdbinit" and add the following line to the file:
	   source pathToWalberla/walberla/utilities/gdbPrettyPrinter/gdbinit.gdb

2) Activation for single debug sessions in eclipse
	- Run -> Debug Configurations -> <select your debug session> 
	- select the "Debugger" tab and use the gdbinit.gdb as "GDB command file"
